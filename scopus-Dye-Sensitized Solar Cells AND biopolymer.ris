AB  - Natural biopolymers have recently attracted a lot of attention for the development of new polymer electrolytes due to their environmental friendliness, nontoxicity, and abundance in nature. Biopolymer electrolytes based on carboxymethyl kappa-carrageenan/carboxymethyl cellulose incorporated with sodium iodide were prepared and their structural and electrochemical stability were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transference number measurement, and linear sweep voltammetry. The film containing 30 wt% sodium iodide had the highest ionic conductivity and the highest relative number of charge carriers at room temperature. The relative number of charge carriers for each prepared electrolyte film in this study increased with salt concentration, according to Barker's electrolyte dissociation theory. The highest conducting electrolyte and the lowest salt concentration electrolyte films were used to fabricate and characterise dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). These DSSCs responded well to a light intensity of 100 mW cm-2. © 2022. The Authors. Published by ESG (www.electrochemsci.org).

AB  - Continual escalation of our world population demands a vast and safe energy supply, the majority of which has been produced by fossil fuel sources. However, because of the huge energy demand, exponential depletion of these nonrenewable energy sources is inescapable and forthcoming in the coming century. Hence, utilization of renewable energy such as solar energy has gained attention because of its direct conversion of light energy into electrical power without any harmful environmental impacts. Solar energy has been harvested by different types of solar cells varying from inorganic to organic to the combination of both. Among them, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with a biopolymer-based electrolyte has gained enormous consideration from researchers because of its sustainability, abundance of available raw material, low production cost, and easy production in addition to the low volatilization of electrolytes compared to liquid state electrolytes. This review aims to give an overview of the recent inputs in the development of biopolymer-based DSSCs. The performance of the biopolymers as electrolytes in DSSCs will be critically reviewed based on the physicochemical properties of the biopolymers. Key technical challenges and future research areas for the advancement of biopolymer-based DSSCs are also discussed. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A Guar Gum-based biopolymer (GG), a characteristic non-ionic polysaccharide extracted from guar beans, is utilized in this work as a cost-effective polymer gel electrolyte towards the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). A redox electrolyte is prepared by stirring Guar Gum biopolymer with a known amount of LiI/I2, 4-tert-butylpyrdine, 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and polyethylene glycol for 24 hrs. The polymer gel electrolyte is carefully characterized through Fourier transform infrared spectra, UV–visible spectrum, Field-emission scanning electron microscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Using this polymer gel electrolyte, dye-sensitized solar cells are fabricated by sandwiching metal-free organic MK-2 dye coated TiO2 photoanode and Pt counter electrode as a photocathode. The photoelectrochemical characterization of the fabricated device shows maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.96% instead of 2.13% obtained with the liquid electrolyte without Guar Gum. The electrolyte containing Guar Gum polymer gel shows ionic conductivity (σ) of 1.46 S [cm]−1 while the liquid electrolyte show 2.44 S [cm]−1. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society

AB  - The vast use of fossil fuel demands the development of new sources of renewable energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively studied due to their competitive cost, ease of fabrication, high degree of tunability and relatively good-energy conversion efficiencies. The performance and stability of DSSCs are limited by leakage and solvent evaporation. This study explores the effects of nanofillers in the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells by incorporating nano-sized titanium dioxide, iron (III) oxide and halloysite fillers into the polymer electrolytes based on κ-carrageenan/DMSO/TBAI:I2. Optimization and characterization of various concentrations of fillers were done before incorporation in solar cells. The effect of ionic conductivity and diffusion coefficient to the overall conversion efficiency of the cells were studied. The effect of squaraine dye was also investigated. The addition of various fillers to the polymer electrolyte system increased the dissociation of iodide ions and improved the ionic conductivity of the cells. The diffusion coefficient of tri-iodide ions was also greatly enhanced because of the increased volume of the system brought about by reducing polymer-polymer interaction, which increased the mobility of the redox couple (I3-/I-). DSSC characterization revealed a low efficiency due to a relatively high charge transfer resistances at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Biopolymer composite membranes based on chitosan doped with an ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl 3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate (EMImSCN) have been developed and characterized. The doped ionic liquid films show remarkable enhancement in ionic conductivity (σ). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction studies (XRD) affirmed the composite nature, good incorporation of ionic liquid and reduction in crystallinity of films, respectively. The interaction between ionic liquid, chitosan and iodide polymer electrolyte matrix was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. The fabricated dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using this new biopolymer electrolyte membranes shows promising performance. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impedance of well-characterized KI-incorporated glucosyl carboxonium ion-based biopolymer crust electrolytes up to a maximum 2.7 wt% was measured using electrical impedance spectroscopy. Enhanced ionic conductivity of 2.3657 × 10−2 S cm−1 on the addition of 2.7 wt% of KI was observed in contrast to earlier reported value for pure GCI of 4.5278 × 10−4 S cm−1. This is attributed due to the increased concentration of KI in the system and is corroborated with increased ion density (n), mobility (µ), and diffusion coefficients (D). Dielectric and modulus study shows the capacitive nature of electrolyte. Fabricated dye-sensitized solar cell using pure glucosyl carboxonium ion crust and KI-incorporated glucosyl carboxonium ion crust shows the efficiency of 1.19% for pure and shows the efficiency of 2.14% for 2.6 wt% of KI in glucosyl carboxonium ion at 1 sun condition. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The fast charge recombination kinetics and poor sensitizing ability in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) result in a significant electron loss and performance degradation. However, the retarding of electron recombination and/or increasing light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) via employing an appropriate interface modifier in DSSCs has rarely been investigated. Here, we first report a molecularly engineered Caf1 protein (both in monomeric and polymeric forms) to modify the surface states by effectively shielding the unfavorable reactions and improve the light absorption properties by introducing alternative anchoring facilities. Using the novel Caf1 biopolymer with high thermal stability (even at 90 °C), we achieved an unprecedented efficiency of 8.31% under standard illumination test conditions and maintain the output performance even under prolonged irradiation. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy measurement reveals an improved electron transfer rate (kET = 0.26 to 0.98 × 108 s-1), whereas the Voc decay rate is lower (70% decay in 90 s) for Caf1-P@TiO2 based cells than that of bare ones (∼85% decay in <10 s). We attributed this trend to the presence of chains in the biopolymer structure and the enhanced population of binding facilities with sensitizer molecules, promoting rapid charge transfer into TiO2 and enhanced dye-loading capability. Our results shed light on the interface engineering, and this novel Caf1 biopolymer offers a meaningful transfer of energy to develop efficient electrochemical cells with attractive properties for scale up and practical applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Abstract: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the potential of both the use of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles as primary filler and graphene as secondary filler in carboxy methyl cellulose based polymer electrolyte. The films were characterized structurally and morphologically by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infra red spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (XRD). XRD results showed that ZnO nanoparticles inclusion reduced the crystallinity of the prepared biopolymer electrolyte. Addition of graphene as secondary filler further reduced the crystallinity of the prepared biopolymer electrolyte film. The FTIR technique and SEM images confirmed the complexation of salts with the polymer matrix. Due to graphene’s ability to create conductive layers, the inclusion of a little amount of it as a supplementary filler increased the A.C. conductivity from 1.63 × 10–5 to 2.6 × 10–4 S cm–1. The synergistic effects of both fillers contributed to raising the polymer electrolyte film’s electrical conductivity. Utilizing this polymer electrolyte layer enabled the creation of a solid state DSSC with an efficiency of 2.6%. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

AB  - In this study, we proposed Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites as novel inorganic additives in locust bean gum (LBG) gel electrolytes for application in an aqueous dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The morphology of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites was characterized by XRD; UV-vis, FTIR, EDX, and XPS spectroscopies; SEM; and TEM. The as-synthesized metal oxide nanocomposites additives are incorporated with iodine/triiodide and an LBG biopolymer gel matrix to construct new aqueous gel electrolyte materials LGE2 (Mn3O4), LGE3 (Mn3O4·CuS) and LGE1 (without additive). Interestingly, an enhanced photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.47% under a 100 mW cm−2 light condition was observed for LGE3 compared to electrolytes (LGE1 and LGE2) due to an effective role of the Mn3O4·CuS additive with TiO2 and the I3− ion of the electrolyte which reduces the recombination reaction. This PCE result was sustained with some criteria of high conductivity, lower charge transfer resistance, high chemical capacitance, and longer electron lifetime. This novel electrolyte material consists of an inorganic additive (Mn3O4·CuS) and aqueous bio gel polymer (LBG) and opens a way for the replacement of costly additive and organic solvents in DSSCs. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry

AB  - In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the copper redox mediator has been proven to enhance power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the fairly low driving force for dye regeneration. In this work, we prepared six blended biopolymer-based electrolytes (E1 to E6) to regenerate N3 Dye absorbed in TiO2 for dye-sensitized solar cell application. The regeneration behavior of three different electron-withdrawing substituents on 2-(pyridin-2-yl)− 1 H-benzo[d]imidazole ligands coordinated with copper metal, its forms [Cu(mpimb)2]1+/2+ (methyl 4-((2-(pyridin-2-yl)− 1 H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)methyl) benzoate), [Cu(pbimb)2]1+/2+ (4-((2-(pyridin-2-yl)− 1 H- benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)methyl) benzonitrile) and [Cu(ptpbi)2]1+/2+ (2-(pyridin-2-yl)− 1(4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl)− 1 H-benzo[d]imidazole). Commencing their electrochemical and photophysical properties determines the molecular orbital energy level of the complex. A quasi-solid-state electrolyte (QSSE) medium is blended in a biopolymer host (pectin and 2-hydroxyethylcellulose). Additionally, a comparison study has been performed between commercially available pyridine-based-additive [tert-butyl pyridine (TBP)], and a bio-organic compound extracted from orange peel waste (1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl) cyclohex-1-ene (limonene)) used as an additive material. Using these newly designed copper redox mediators and additives, the six sets of DSSCs devices has constructed. The cell structure is assembled as TiO2/N3 dye/electrolyte (E1 to E6)/Pt. Among the fabricated devices, C1 and C2 redox couples [Cu(ptpbi)2]1+/2+ having CF3 substituent exhibit maximum Voc and Jsc. Interestingly, the device with limonene additive exhibited PCE up to 4.4 %, whereas with TBP, it showed 4.0 % efficiency. The PCE results of the C2 device sustained some electrochemical factors such as Bulk Resistance (Rb =142.0 Ω), Recombination Resistance (Rrec = 191.4 Ω), Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct = 98.84 Ω), Chemical capacitance (Cμ = 7.882 μF), Ionic Conductivity (σ = 2.816 ×10−04 S cm−1), electron lifetime (τn = 16.24 μs), Diffusion length (Ln =1.39 × 10−01 mm). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, we prepared a new natural sensitizer from blood berry extract (BB dye) and coupled it with a series of biopolymer gel electrolytes consisting of Co2+/3+or I-/I3-, such as GE 1, GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, GE 5, and GE 6. An as-prepared natural dye was characterized via UV-visible spectroscopy to confirm the behavior of the dye, which showed an absorption range at 484 nm. The interaction between the TiO2surface and the BB dye was analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) studies. All six biogel electrolytes were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques to validate the integration of redox mediators into polymer hosts. The bioelectrolytes GE 1, GE 2, GE 4, and GE 5 contain a single polymer matrix (xanthan gum or gelatin) and showed a very low photo-conversion efficiency. At the same time, GE 3 and GE 6 contain a blended polymer matrix (xanthan gum and gelatin) and achieved a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.86 and 2.06%, respectively, under 1 sun illumination. The redox mediator Co2+/3+or I-/I3-incorporated into both single and blended polymer matrixes played a vital role in regenerating the BB dye. In this case, the bioblended polymer gel electrolyte (GE 6) consisting of a Co2+/3+redox pair attained a high conductivity of 5.97 × 10-5S/cm-1and a chemical capacitance of 15.02 ×10-6F compared to the I-/I3--incorporated electrolyte. The PCE reports were sustained by the electrochemical impedance spectrum results such as a larger charge at the Pt/electrolyte interface, a lower charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and a higher chemical capacitance. The introduction of a biopolymer cobalt redox-based gel electrolyte with the natural BB dye improves the electron lifetime and readily reduces the recombination reaction. The integration of a natural dye with a blended biopolymer gel electrolyte can pave the way to generate new eco-friendly dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with high stability. © 2021 American Chemical Society

AB  - The synthesis of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) of Mw ranging from 4000 to 180,000 g mol-1 is realized with molar ratios [COOH]0/[OH]0 of 1 and 0.98, and varying amounts of titanium (IV) tetrabutoxide (TBT) catalyst. Polycondensation kinetics are followed by chemical titration of carboxylic groups, and the kinetic rate constants of self-catalyzed and external-catalyzed reactions are calculated. The synthesis of PBS with high molar mass follows the classical Flory theory. The effect of molar mass on PBS thermal properties is also studied. A faster crystallization rate and a higher temperature of crystallization are observed, for very high molar masses. This behavior could be due to a memory effect of the polymer. Complex melting behavior of PBS is induced by a continuous reorganization of the crystalline phase, as observed by MTDSC. DSC measurements also reveal that the crystallinity - and so the amorphous phase - is limited to about 35% when the molar mass Mn is higher than 40,000 g mol -1. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

AB  - Chitosan, a biopolymer derived from crab shells which is insoluble in common organic solvents has been converted to the organosoluble N-phthaloylchitosan (PhCh) by reaction with phthalic anhydride in dimethylformamide (DMF). The formation and structure of PhCh was confirmed by the characteristic peaks of phthalimido and aromatic groups observed at 719, 1708 and 1772 cm-1 and two sets of peaks centered at 3.0 and 7.5 ppm obtained from FTIR and 1H NMR analyses respectively. Gel polymer electrolytes consisting of PhCh, ethylene carbonate (EC), and DMF with various amounts of tetrapropylammonium iodide (TPAI) and iodine were prepared. The interaction behavior between polymer-plasticizer-salt was thoroughly investigated using FTIR spectroscopy. The gel polymer electrolyte consisting of PhCh:EC:DMF:TPAI:I2 in a weight ratio (g) of 0.1:0.3:0.3:0.12:0.012 showed the highest conductivity of 5.46 × 10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature and exhibited the best performance in DSSCs with efficiency of 5.0%, with JSC of 12.72 mA cm-2, VOC of 0.60 V and fill factor of 0.66. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Fabrication of quasi-solid state polymer electrolytes are recently being endorsed by electrochemists due to its superior electrical and physical properties. With the aspiration to develop a sustainable electrolyte component, this study is a novel attempt to fabricate quasi-solid electrolyte based on esterified starch. Potato starch was chemically modified via simple phthaloylation method. The resulting amorphous, hydrophobic starch derivative was used as a polymer base to prepare cost effective thermoplastic gel electrolytes via incorporation of propylene carbonate, dimethylformamide and lithium iodide. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction characterizations verified the impact of phthaloylation and plasticization in suppressing the crystallinity and hydrophilicity of starch. The biopolymer gel with 40 wt.% LiI recorded the highest room temperature ionic conductivity of 4.82 mS cm-1. The sample with highest ionic conductivity recorded the best efficiency of 3.56%, which is one of the highest values for starch electrolyte-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The optimized efficiency indicate that starch-based electrolyte has good prospects for fabrication of quasi-solid DSSC. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Substantially to increase the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), it has been fabricated with the polymer gel electrolytes (PGEs) by replacing the liquid electrolytes (LEs). Poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) has been synthesized as a crystalline solid biopolymer of about 74% yield using different 6-membered ring phenolate Al complexes. As prepared PCL was blended with LE used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to prepare high polydispersity index (PDI) PGE. The prepared PGE shows cross-linking between carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and interacts with iodide ions to form a chelate complex structure. The PGE was well-characterized using various analytical tools to demonstrate its structural and surface morphology. The fabricated DSSCs using PGE showed high ionic conductivity (7.76 × 10−4 S cm−1), good tri-iodide diffusion (2.052 × 10−6 Cm2 S−1), and a highly stable incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (PCE; 5.92%) under solar light illumination (85 mW cm−2). Besides found PGE has improved long-term stability up to 15 days, and these results proved that the prepared PGE is superior compared to other reported PGEs. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Gluten-free bread crumb generally firms more rapidly than regular wheat bread crumb. We here combined differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), texture analysis, and time-domain proton nuclear magnetic resonance (TD 1H NMR) to investigate the mechanisms underlying firming of gluten-free rice and oat bread. The molecular mobility of water and biopolymers in flour/water model systems and changes thereof after heating and subsequent cooling to room temperature were investigated as a basis for underpinning the interpretation of TD 1H NMR profiles of fresh crumb. The proton distributions of wheat and rice flour/water model systems were comparable, while that of oat flour/water samples showed less resolved peaks and an additional population at higher T2 relaxation times representing lipid protons. No significant crumb moisture loss during storage was observed for the gluten-free bread loaves. Crumb firming was mainly caused by amylopectin retrogradation and water redistribution within bread crumb. DSC, texture, and TD 1H NMR data correlated well and showed that starch retrogradation and crumb firming are much more pronounced in rice flour bread than in oat flour bread. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Environmentally benign biopolymer nanofibrous membrane was fabricated and applied as a quasi-solid state (QSS) electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). In this study, electrospun (PVA/PA/PIL/C) nanofibrous membrane was tailored from phthaloyl agarose (PA), poly(3-butyl-1-vinyl imidazolium iodide) (PIL) along with conductive carbon (C) incorporated in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The morphology, structure and physical properties (electrolyte uptake, porosity) of the membranes were analysed and their photovoltaic and electrochemical effects as electrolyte in DSSC device were studied. The best QSS-DSSC with PVA/PA/PIL/C membrane exhibited good short circuit current density (Jsc = 13.1 mA/cm2), high open circuit voltage (Voc = 0.79 V), comparable power conversion efficiency (η = 6.05%) and greater stability (up to 82% of its initial conversion efficiency after 500 h). This membrane based electrolyte enunciates the great outlook for the advancement of stable and efficient DSSCs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An innovative biopolymer composite electrolyte for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), obtained by quasi-solidifying an indigenous liquid electrolyte containing supporting salts and I3-/I- redox couple with a mixture of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC) is proposed. This is the first ever report indicating the useful aspects of CMC as a component in the electrolyte of a photovoltaic device and the requisite parameters are thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the performances of the lab scale quasi-solid devices are presented by means of a combined photovoltaic-chemometric approach, definitely innovative for the study of polymer based electrolytes for DSSCs. We also present the durability of the devices inherited by different PEO:CMC ratios as well as the response of the cells to various wavelengths and irradiation intensities. The intriguing photovoltaic-chemometric approach allows developing a device with efficiencies up to 5.18% under 1 sun irradiation (∼7% under 0.4 sun). The cumulative effect by the strategic components employed in the gel-polymer electrolyte demonstrates an outstanding durability with an excellent efficiency as high as 98% even after 250 h of extreme aging conditions. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Owing to ecological concerns and the rapid increase in fossil fuel consumption, sustainable and efficient generation technologies are being developed. The present work aimed at manufacturing DSSC that is based on natural elements for converting the sun energy into electrical energy. ZnO nano materials are used in solar cells as binary compound semiconductor according to their stability, better conductivity, excellent mobility, the best affinity of electrons, and lower cost compared to other semiconductors. Recently, nanocellulose has shown potential as an advanced nanomaterial used in electrochemical conversion devices since it is considered the best abundant Earth biopolymer and is inexpensive and versatile. The constructed DSSC composed of plant nanocellulose (PNC) extracted from banana peel and nano-chlorophyll dye extracted from aloe vera were evaluated as the electrolyte and sensitiser, respectively. With increasing PNC content from 0 to 32 wt.%, both PV parameters and lifetime increase, and voltage decay decreases. The nano particles size modification for three materials carried by ultrasonic waves. Increasing the ultrasonic wave exposure time reduced the size of the Chl particles. The addition of PNC from banana peel to DSSC electrolyte is shown effective. The effect of varying the PNC/nano-chlorophyll content (0–32 wt.%) on the photovoltaic parameters of the DSSC was investigated. The addition of PNC significantly increased the fill factor and sunlight conversion efficiency. The DSSCs showed acceptable performance under relatively low irradiation conditions and different light intensities, indicating that they are suitable for outdoor applications. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper reports the latest work in our laboratory on biopolymer electrolyte for dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) application. Biopolymer electrolyte comprises agarose, potassium iodide (KI) were dissolved in two different solvents dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To further achieve the reasonable conductivity for DSSC application we have added a low viscosity ionic liquid (IL) in the biopolymer electrolytes. The room temperature conductivity maximum was obtained near 60:40 compositions. Structural, electrical and photo electrochemical studies have been carried out in details and explained. These electrolytes were further used in the fabrication of DSSC, and comparative measured values of the fill factor (FF), Open circuit voltage (Voc), current density (Jsc) and efficiency at 100 mW/cm were tabulated. The results obtained from data evaluation affirm that biopolymer – IL gel electrolytes appears promising candidates for energy devices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper deals with the synthesis, characterization, and application of low-viscosity ionic liquids as dopants and biopolymers as the host. The biopolymer used in the present study is cornstarch, while the ionic liquid 1-ethyl 3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate (EMIm+SCN-) is used to develop an electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Different weight ratios of the ionic liquid are incorporated in the polymer host to develop a highly conducting ionic-liquid-doped biopolymer electrolyte (ILBPE). Electrical, structural, and photoelectrochemical characterizations are carried out in detail. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that doping different weight ratios of the ionic liquid enhances the ionic conductivity and conductivity maxima observed at a weight ratio of 80 of the ionic liquid, with an ionic conductivity value of 2.6 × 10-4 S cm-1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) affirm a reduction in the crystallinity, while thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows thermal stability of the ILBPE beyond 200 °C. In addition, the 80% ILBPE-based EDLC exhibits a specific capacitance of 140 F g-1-, an energy density of 23.13 Wh kg-1, and a power density of 3600 W kg-1 calculated based on galvanostatic charge-discharge (GDC), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies. Moreover, the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC is investigated by using J-V analysis and EIS measurements, while the overall power conversion efficiency is determined as 4% under standard conditions (AM 1.5). © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, plant biopolymer gum Acacia is synthesised and chemically modified by fruit extract of black grapes (Vitis vinifera), eggplant (Solanum melongena). Fruits contain functional groups called chromophore which confer colour. It is the region where radiation is absorbed and electron is transferred between two energy states. They absorb UV and/or visible light. They are conjugated unsaturated bonds and responsible for optical and electrical properties. In the present work, optical properties of biopolymer gum Acacia specimen and chromophore induced specimen of the above-mentioned fruits are examined by UV-visible spectroscopy. It is found that light absorption is pronounced in the visible range of spectrum compared to the pure specimen in which absorption is found to be observed in the deep ultraviolet range. Electrical characterisation of the modified gum Acacia biopolymer with grape fruit extract and eggplant extract are observed. Electrical conductivity is enhanced over pure specimen. These properties will be fruitful in dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) application, which is an ongoing extensive research area. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) samples were prepared by the annealing under 100 MPa at 75-145°C and 200 MPa at 105-145°C for 6 h, respectively. The crystalline structures, thermal properties and morphology were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). On the basis of the DSC and WAXD results, it can be seen that the α′ form was formed by the annealing under 100 MPa at 85-95°C but not found under 200 MPa at 105-145°C. A phase diagram of PLLA crystal form under high pressure was constructed under the given experimental conditions, which displayed the α′ form was formed at limited temperature and pressure range. Besides, SEM suggested that the PLLA samples annealed under 100 MPa crystallize to form lamellar-like crystals due to the low growth rate and the confined crystallization behavior under high pressure. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Recently, the study of new DSSC structures such as photoanodes, electrolytes, and counter electrodes (CE) have gained the attention of researchers. Combining these features allows DSSC to have a flexible and versatile way of working. Titanium dioxide-graphene (TiO2-G) nanocomposite containing 3 wt % graphene (G) was successfully fabricated and employed as the photoanode for the fabrication of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Agarose (3 wt %) together with potassium iodide (KI) were prepared as gel electrolytes and polyaniline-graphene oxide (PANI-GO) served as the counter electrode (CE). In UV–visible spectroscopy, doping of graphene on TiO2 led to a remarkable reduction of the band gap energy from 3.0 eV (TiO2) to 2.4 eV (TiO2-G). The presence of agarose in the KI solution facilitated the creation of fine channels, promoting ionic transfer in electrolytes, as revealed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Moreover, the current-voltage (I–V) curve for TiO2-G/3 wt % agarose gel electrolyte/PANI-GO demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 1.1324% with optimal values for short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) of 34.48 mA/cm2, 0.1105 V, and 0.2972, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) illustrated redox potential occurrences at −0.2 V and +0.2 V, corresponding to oxidation and reduction processes, confirming the chemical stability of DSSC. The system demonstrated stability after 10 cycles, maintaining consistent current (μA) and voltage (V) patterns even after 20 cycles. These results demonstrate the efficient and cost-effective DSSC system's capacity to maintain stability and guarantee consistent energy conversion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biopolymers are among the most promising electrolyte hosts for different electrochemical devices in the energy conversion and storage fields. In this work, the potential of chitosan as a biopolymer laden with NaI salt is explored and applied as solid polymer electrolyte for dye sensitised solar cells. The chitosan-NaI electrolyte is successfully prepared via a simple and upscalable solution casting technique. Infrared spectroscopy analysis highlights interactions between chitosan and NaI, that weaken the semi-crystalline domains of chitosan and favour the conduction of the redox shuttle ions between cell electrodes. At room temperature, the best ionic conductivity was obtained for the samples laden with NaI 30 wt%, with values equal to 1.11 × 10−4 S cm−1. Na+ transference number determination indicates that only 0.9% of the ionic conductivity is determined by these cations, thus highlighting that I− anions represent the active species in the newly proposed solid-state electrolyte. This result is highly desired considering that these anions are those responsible for the regeneration of oxidized dye molecules in the cell and, overall, for the cell efficiency. Current-voltage measurement of solid-state photovoltaic devices under simulated sunlight led to a reproducible and stable power conversion efficiency of 0.06%, along with a short-circuit current density of 0.32 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.7 V and a fill factor 0.3. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) offer the potential for ultralow cost mass-producible photovoltaic devices. Other advantages are light weight and good mechanical flexibility. To further reduce the cost, the replacement of the conventional conducting substrates for cellulose is an interesting choice. There are three main types of nanocellulose materials: nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), nanocrystalline cellulose (CNC), and bacterial nanocellulose. In this work, the synthesis of two types of nanocellulose substrates and their application in OPVs were achieved. For the first time, the different properties of the cellulose substrates and their influence on the OPV performance were addressed. The nanocellulose substrates CNC and NFC were characterized by XRD, AFM, and DSC. CNC films were more homogeneous, smoother, crystalline and with low roughness. Thus, when comparing the cellulosic substrates, the best device the one based on CNC. The PCE values of the inverted OPV cells were 3.0, 1.4, and 0.5% on to glass, CNC and NFC substrates. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Renewable energy systems represent a milestone of third millennium applied scientific research. As a viable, economic and environmentally friendly alternative to the solid electrolytes currently used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), here we propose a biopolymer derived from seaweeds, which undergoes a process of selective carboxylation to improve its transport properties. Subsequently, a chemometric approach is used to tune the amount of salts and additives, and the highest ever measured ionic conductivity for a biopolymeric solid electrolyte has been reached (5.53 â™ © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Solvent free, ionic liquid based redox electrolytes were prepared and subsequently solidified using agarose natural polysaccharide. The electrolytes were thoroughly characterized, and their electrical properties were investigated, while they were incorporated in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) that presented excellent efficiency (PCE = 3.98%), higher than the corresponding reference liquid electrolyte (PCE = 3.84%). At the same time, they compare well to DSCs using solid redox electrolytes based on the poly ethylene oxide, this comparison highlighting the device stability and great potential of the biopolymers as efficient solidifiers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An intensive correlation has been attempted on 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole ligand-coordinated cobalt and copper metal complex electrolytes (Co2+/3+ [ptpbi]3 and Cu1+/2+ [ptpbi]2) with blend biopolymer electrolyte based on Locust Bean Gum and Pectin (LP) as a host matrix to enhance the performance of organic DPTCY sensitizer (2D-π-D′-A-π-A). Comparatively, the ligand coupled bulky CF3 acceptor on the para position of benzyl moiety-substituted 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-benzimidazole (on the N–H position) [ptpbi]-coordinated copper metal complex shows a higher redox potential (0.62 V vs NHE) compare to Co2+/3+ redox system. The photovoltaic performance of thio-bridged pyridinyl based organic compounds (MPP and DSP) with/without highly electron-donating substituents (methyl group) as an additive in QSSE host for dye-sensitized solar cell applications has been employed. A thorough investigation has been made for blending polysaccharide polymer-based electrolytes E1 to E4 through DSC, FTIR, UV–Vis spectroscopic techniques. The analysis of assembled device as [TiO2/DPTCY Dye/Mn+/m + redox/additive/LP blend biopolymer/Pt] has achieved a maximum PCE of 5.97% under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) condition with 1.5AM. These results signify a record for copper complex with methyl-substituted thio-bridged pyridinyl (MPP) with higher efficiency. These devices had shown a higher chemical capacitance (6.06 × 10−6 F), recombination resistance (25.5 Ω), charge transfer resistance (5.67 Ω), ionic conductivity (1.568 (S cm−1) × 10−3), electron lifetime (48.97 ms), diffusion coefficient (2.63 × 10−7 cm−2 s), dielectric constant (2.76 × 102) and dielectric loss (4.41 × 103) compared with other substitution-based additives. These additives have trapped the diffusion of Cu2+ and Co3+ ion species has resulted in the constraint resistance and enhancement of the catalytic effect of the counter electrode. The higher charge relaxation time and a negative shift in the Quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 arise by correlating photocurrent and photovoltage in suppression of recombination reaction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report a new biopolymer electrolyte for dye sensitized solar cell application. To develop polymer electrolyte, potassium iodide have been added in agarose biopolymer matrix and characterized using various techniques like complex impedance spectroscopy, Infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Complex impedance spectroscopy shows many folds enhancement in ionic conductivity (σ) by salt doping and conductivity maxima was obtained near 60:40 composition. Infrared spectroscopy confirms the formation of composite nature. XRD revels the reduction of crystallinity by salt doping as well affirms the composite nature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows reduction in crystallinity of gel matrix by salt doping which is a known favorable condition for ionic conductivity enhancement. To further affirm the conductivity enhancement in the gel electrolyte system a theoretical hopping model is also described in details. A DSSC has been developed using maximum electrical conductivity film which shows 0.54% efficiency at 1 sun condition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Abstract: Starch and cellulose have long been used in various industrial applications as gelating agents. In this work, the intrinsic adhesive properties of these biopolymers are exploited for application as electrolytes in DSSC. Firstly, potato starch was chemically modified into phthaloyl starch in a facile esterification process. Fabrication of polymer electrolyte with phthaloyl starch (PhSt) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) incorporated with dimethylformamide and tetrapropylammonium iodide produced homogeneous gels with diminished crystallinity. Infusion of different weight percentages of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) into the gels were revealed to further suppress polymer crystallinity and elevate ionic conductivity. Rheological analysis revealed that addition of up to 6 wt% of ionic liquid aid in elevating the rigidity, strength and tackiness of the gels. The improved adhesiveness of the gels can be correlated to effective reduction of interfacial resistance and restraining of recombination reactions based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Quasi-solid DSSC fabricated with PhSt-HEC with 8 wt% of BMII exhibited enhanced short-circuit current density, JSC and fill factor, contributing to an optimized efficiency of 5.20%.

AB  - In commercialization of liquid dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), whose leakage, evaporation and toxicity of organic solvents are limiting factors, replacement of organic solvents with water-based gel electrolyte is recommended. This work reports on utilizing and comparison of chitosan and chitosan nanoparticle as different gelling agents in preparation of water-based gel electrolyte in fabrication of dye sensitized solar cells. All photovoltaic parameters such as open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), short circuit current density (Jsc) and conversion efficiency (η) were measured. For further characterization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the charge transfer at Pt/electrolyte interface and charge recombination and electron transport at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Significant improvements in conversion efficiency and short circuit current density of DSSCs fabricated by chitosan nanoparticle were observed that can be attributed to the higher mobility of I3−due to the lower viscosity and smaller size of chitosan nanoparticles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report simultaneous dissolution of agarose (AG) and chitosan (CH) in varying proportions in an ionic liquid (IL), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [C4mim][Cl]. Composite materials were constructed from AG-CH-IL solutions using the antisolvent methanol, and IL was recovered from the solutions. Composite materials could be uniformly decorated with silver oxide (Ag2O) nanoparticles (Ag NPs) to form nanocomposites in a single step by in situ synthesis of Ag NPs in AG-CH-IL sols, wherein the biopolymer moiety acted as both reducing and stabilizing agent. Cooling of Ag NPs-AG-CH-IL sols to room temperature resulted in high conductivity and high mechanical strength nanocomposite ionogels. The structure, stability and physiochemical properties of composite materials and nanocomposites were characterized by several analytical techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), CD spectroscopy, differential scanning colorimetric (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and scanning electron micrography (SEM). The result shows that composite materials have good thermal and conformational stability, compatibility and strong hydrogen bonding interactions between AG-CH complexes. Decoration of Ag NPs in composites and ionogels was confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, EDAX and XRD. The mechanical and conducting properties of composite ionogels have been characterized by rheology and current-voltage measurements. Since Ag NPs show good antimicrobial activity, Ag NPs -AG-CH composite materials have the potential to be used in biotechnology and biomedical applications whereas nanocomposite ionogels will be suitable as precursors for applications such as quasi-solid dye sensitized solar cells, actuators, sensors or electrochromic displays. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Renewable energy, such as solar energy, is infinite, readily available, and has extensive applications. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been well developed; thus, they can be developed with low production costs, high efficiency, and facile manufacturing techniques. This study proposes a novel chitosan biopolymer-based perylene dye; the dye is modified by chitosan with perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic anhydride using a one-pot acylation of nitrogen nucleophiles for DSSCs. The chitosan biopolymer-based perylene dyes were characterized using attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, solid-state 13C CP-TOSS nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, and high-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy of chitosan biopolymer-based perylene dye exhibited a red-shift compared with perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic anhydride and chitosan. The DSSC properties of chitosan biopolymer-based perylene dye were investigated, and it exhibited a 2.022 % power-conversion efficiency. Thus, this promising chitosan biopolymer-based perylene dye may have potential applications in solar-cell technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dye-sensitized solar cells based on biopolymer gel electrolyte systems deal with the perspective of good power conversion efficiency with low-cost fabrication. In this work, we synthesized an electron-rich triphenylamine core as an organic additive for hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) polymer gel electrolytes with a redox couple (I-/I3-), which is efficient for DSSCs. The presence of a more conjugated system and heteroatoms in additives paved the way for the whole mobility transport and quasi-Fermi level shift, which reduces the recombination reaction between the TiO2 surface and I3- ion, enhancing the organic photovoltaic properties. The electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of HEC gel electrolytes without additives (bare HEC) and with an additive (4-(di(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methyl)-N,N-diphenylaniline (DPMDA), (1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline (PIDA), 4-(di(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methyl)-N-(4-(di(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methyl)phenyl)-N-phenylaniline (DPMPPA), N-(4-(1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)phenyl)-4-(1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)-N-phenylaniline (DPIPA), tris(4-(di(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methyl)phenyl)amine (TDPMPA), and tris(4-(1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)phenyl)amine (TPIPA)) were studied, respectively; one of the organic additive tris(4-(1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)phenyl)amine [TPIPA]-based polymer gel electrolytes (A6: TiO2/N3 dye/HEC/I-/I3-/TPIPA/Pt) showed good electrochemical properties, longer electron lifetime, and hence an improved photoconversion efficiency of 5.72% with better stability under light illumination of 100 mW/cm2. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have become a validated and economically credible competitor to the traditional solid-state junction photovoltaic devices. DSSCs based on biopolymer gel electrolyte systems offer the perspective of competitive conversion efficiencies with a very low-cost fabrication. In this paper, a new starch-based biopolymer gel electrolyte system is prepared by mixing lithium iodide and iodine with bare and citric acid cross-linked potato starches with glycerol as the plasticizing agent. The effect of the preparation methods on the starch cross-linking degree as well as the photoconversion efficiency of the resulting DSSC cells is carefully analyzed. Fourier transform spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the morphology and conformational changes of starch in the electrolytes. The conductivity of the biopolymer electrolytes was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. DSSC based on the starch-gel polymer electrolytes were characterized by photovoltaic measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results clearly show that the cross-linking increases the recombination resistance and open circuit voltage (VOC) of the DSSC, and thereby the photoconversion efficiency of the cell. In particular, electrolytes containing 1.4 g bare and cross-linked starches showed ionic conductivities of s = 1.61, 0.59, 0.38, and 0.35 S cm-1, and the corresponding DSSCs showed efficiencies of 1.2, 1.4, 0.93, and 1.11%, respectively. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The current energy situation requires not only enormous energy in a brief period of time but clean energy as well. In this direction, a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) - supercapacitor (SC) integrated energy device has been fabricated. This embedded energy system has a specific advantage such as easy manufacturing, low manufacturing costs, and flexible substrates compatibility. A natural photosensitizer was extracted from readily available beetroots and characterized using ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy. The zinc oxide semiconductor was synthesized using microwave technique and regarded as the DSSC photoanode material. The ZnO's phase, purity, and morphology were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope. The iodine-doped cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) biopolymer electrolyte functions as the DSSC and supercapacitor electrolyte. The solid polymer electrolyte conductivity and dielectric studies were performed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The laser-induced technique was used to synthesize graphene that plays a dual purpose as photocathode in DSSC and supercapacitor electrodes. The embedded energy unit from the DSSC-supercapacitor demonstrates a 6.75% fill factor representing its decent efficiency.  © 2019 by ASME.

AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the solid biopolymer electrolytes based on a carboxymethyl κ-carrageenan/carboxymethyl cellulose blend complexed with lithium iodide of various weight ratios. The complexation of the doping salt with the polymer blend was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Ionic conductivity of the film was determined by impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 4 MHz and in the temperature range of 303-338 K. The ionic conductivity increased with the increase in lithium iodide concentration as well as temperature. The membrane comprising 30 wt % of lithium iodide was found to give the highest conductivity of 3.89 × 10-3 S· cm-1 at room temperature. The increase in conductivity was associated with the increase in the number as well as the mobility of the charge carries. The conductivity increase with temperature followed the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher model. The fabricated dye-sensitive solar cell, FTO/TiO2-dye/CMKC/CMCE-LiI (30 wt %) +I2/Pt exhibited the highest conversion efficiency of 0.11% at a light intensity of 100 mW·cm-2. This indicated that the biopolymer blend electrolyte system has potential for use in dye-sensitized solar cells. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Biopolymer hybrid electrolytes based on carboxymethyl kappa-carrageenan/carboxymethyl cellulose doped with various cation sizes of iodide salts were prepared using the solution casting method. Lithium iodide, sodium iodide, ammonium iodide, and N–N-Dimethyl-N-(methyl-sulfanylmethylene) ammonium iodide are the doping salts used in this work. The Fourier transform infrared spectra and thermal analysis of all four systems prove the occurrence of complexation between the host polymer and the iodide salts. Impedance study showed that the ionic conductivity increased with an increase in salt concentration. The highest ionic conductivities were 3.89 × 10–3 S cm−1, 4.55 × 10–3 S cm−1, 2.41 × 10–3 S cm−1 and 6.68 × 10–3 S cm−1 for biopolymer hybrid systems containing lithium iodide (30 wt%), sodium iodide (30 wt%), ammonium iodide (30 wt%) and N–N-Dimethyl-N-(methyl-sulfanylmethylene) ammonium iodide (40 wt%). The temperature-dependent conductivity study revealed that all of the carboxymethyl kappa-carrageenan/carboxymethyl cellulose hybrid-based electrolytes followed the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher model conductivity-temperature behavior. The dye-sensitized solar cell fabricated (DSSC) with carboxymethyl kappa-carrageenan/carboxymethyl cellulose-40 wt% of N–N-Dimethyl-N-(methyl-sulfanylmethylene) ammonium iodide electrolyte showed good response under light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and exhibited the highest efficiency of 0.21%, confirming that hybrid biopolymer systems can potentially be used for the fabrication of efficient DSSC. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We have reported the synthesis of methyl cellulose-based biopolymer electrolyte incorporated with ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide varying from 10 to 100wt% with respect to biopolymer. Detailed studies like polarized optical microscopy (POM), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dielectric constant, and impedance spectroscopy were analyzed in detail. The maximum ionic conductivity was attained at 60wt%. IL incorporated with MC polymer which shows maximum conductivity value of 1.93 × 10−2 S/cm. Finally, we have fabricated an EDLC and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using maximum IL-doped MC which shows high specific capacitance value of 38 F/g and efficiency of 0.46% at 1 sun condition, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl, 2-methyl imidazolium thiocyanate incorporated biopolymer system is reported in this communication for applications in dual energy devices, i.e., electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The solution caste method has been used to synthesize ionic-liquid-incorporated biopolymer electrolyte films. The IL mixed biopolymer electrolytes achieve high ionic conductivity up to the order of 10−3 S/cm with good thermal stability above 250 °C. Electrical, structural, and optical studies of these IL-doped biopolymer electrolyte films are presented in detail. The performance of EDLCs was evaluated using low-frequency electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and constant current charge–discharge, while that of DSSCs was assessed using J–V characteristics. The EDLC cells exhibited a high specific capacitance of 200 F/gram, while DSSCs delivered 1.53% efficiency under sun conditions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Solid biopolymer-based electrolytes have been synthesized and characterized. Potassium iodide (KI) and iodine have been added in a biopolymer (sago palm) matrix to develop solid polymer electrolyte. Relationships between electrical and ionic transport parameters have been studied in detail, and the mechanism for ion transport has been proposed. Impedance spectroscopy reveals a significant enhancement in ionic conductivity by salt doping and the conductivity maxima was obtained at 50 wt% of KI concentration and also the system displays Arrhenius behavior. Dielectric phenomenon, mobility, charge carrier density, and diffusion coefficient also supports the conductivity data. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the formation of a complex structure, while X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy affirms the complex structure as well as a reduction of crystallinity in the biopolymer electrolyte by salt doping. A dye-sensitized solar cell fabricated using fluorine-doped tin oxide-titanium dioxide (N3 dye)/maximum conducting electrolyte showed the short-circuit current density of 2.91 × 10-4 A cm-2, open-circuit voltage of 0.58 V, and efficiency of 0.57% at 1 sun condition. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - In this work, carboxymethyl kappa-carrageenan was used as the principle host for developing new biopolymer electrolytes based on the blend of carboxymethyl kappa-carrageenan/carboxymethyl cellulose. The blending of carboxymethyl cellulose into carboxymethyl kappa-carragenan was found to be a promising strategy to improve the material properties such as conductive properties. The electrolyte samples were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, ionic transference number measurement and linear sweep voltammetry in order to investigate their structural, thermal and electrochemical properties. Impedance study showed that the ionic conductivity increased with the increment of ammonium iodide concentration. The highest room temperature ionic conductivity achieved was 2.41 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 30 wt% of the salt. The increment of conductivity was due to the increase of formation of transient cross-linking between the carboxymethyl kappa-carrageenan/carboxymethyl cellulose chains and the doping salt as indicated the Tg trend. The conductivity was also attributed by the increase in the number of charge carriers in the biopolymer electrolytes system. The interactions between polymers and salt were confirmed by FTIR study. The transference number measurements showed that the conductivity was predominantly ionic. Temperature dependent conductivity study showed that conductivity increased with the reciprocal of temperature. The conductivity-temperature plots suggested that the conductivity obeyed the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher relation and the activation energy for the best conducting sample was 0.010 eV. This system was used for the fabrication of dye sensitized solar cells, FTO/TiO2-dye/CMKC/CMCE-NH4I + I2/Pt. The fabricated cell showed response under light intensity of 100 mW cm-2 with efficiency of 0.13% indicating that the blend biopolymer system has potential to be applied in dye sensitized solar cell. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper a carbohydrate polymer (Phytagel/gellan gum) based solid gel electrolyte synthesis and its application in dye sensitized solar cell is reported. Potassium iodide has been added in Gelrite/Phytagel biopolymer matrix to develop solid gel electrolyte. Complex impedance spectroscopy shows liquid like ionic conductivity, with maximum conductivity 2.5 × 10-2 S cm-1 at 60:40 composition. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) confirms the formation of complex nature while x-ray diffraction (XRD) affirms the composite nature and suppression in crystallinity by salt doping. Polarized microscopy (POM) shows enhancement in amorphousity of gel matrix by salt doping which is a known favourable condition for ionic conductivity enhancement in gel electrolyte system and supported by our XRD data. A dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has been fabricated using maximum conductivity which shows with Jsc = 3.2 × 10-3 mA/cm2, Voc = 0.57, FF = 0.90, η = 1.47 at 1 sun condition. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.
